    <h1>Chandu's Website about happiness</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Happiness</strong> is an electrifying and elusive state.
      Philosophers, theologians, psychologists, and even economists have long
      sought to define it. And since the 1990s, a whole branch of
      psychology—positive psychology—has been dedicated to pinning it down. More
      than simply positive mood, happiness is a state of well-being that
      encompasses living a good life, one with a sense of meaning and deep
      contentment. Feeling joyful has its health perks as well. A growing body
      of research also suggests that happiness can improve your physical health;
      feelings of
      <strong>
        positivity and fullfilment seem to benefit cardiovascular health
      </strong>
      , the immune system, inflammation levels, and blood pressure, among other
      things. Happiness has even been linked to a
      <strong>longer lifespan</strong> as well as a higher quality of life and
      well-being. Attaining happiness is a global pursuit. Researchers find that
      people from every corner of the world rate happiness more important than
      other desirable personal outcomes, such as obtaining wealth, acquiring
      material goods, and getting into heaven.
